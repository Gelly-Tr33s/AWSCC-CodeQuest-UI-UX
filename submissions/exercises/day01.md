&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: I find using Lazada easier to find the product that I'm looking for. 
It provides additional details of the product in the results such as brand and category making the product search much easier.

    Answer: The adunbance of ads and promotions (such as sales and vouchers) in the home page (especially in Shopee mobile) makes the navigation confusing.

    Answer: I find Lazada much easier to scan and understand since the site home page are much cleaner and contains less distractions and unnecessary elements as well as more accessible navigation bar that makes it easier to search for the content that users needed.

    Answer: Both websites are responsive across different. It is very responsive in the desktop version of both sites. Both sites are also very responsive on mobile as well as older phones (more than 4 years).
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: When it comes to the visual aspect of the website, Shopee is better because it provides visuals (pictures) of most products as well as the brand logo of products. Aside from visuals of products, it utilizes the color orange which is the part of its brand. Making it easily recognizable as a Shopee website.
